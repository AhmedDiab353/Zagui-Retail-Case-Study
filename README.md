Zagui Retail Case Study – Relational Database Design &amp; Implementation
CS 306 – Database Systems

Designed and implemented a comprehensive relational database system for a fictional retail company to manage customer transactions, product inventory, vendor relationships, and regional sales data. The project followed a structured database development process including ER modeling, schema normalization, SQL scripting, and data population.

Key Contributions:

Database Design: Created an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram and relational schema covering 8 interconnected entities: Region, Store, Vendor, Customer, Category, Product, SalesTransaction, and SoldVia.

SQL Development: Wrote SQL scripts to create and populate tables with sample retail data, using foreign keys and constraints to ensure referential integrity.

Data Analysis: Developed 10 SQL queries to extract insights such as average product prices by category, total items sold, and identifying transactions for specific products.

Normalization & Integrity: Ensured all tables were normalized (3NF) and structured for efficient querying and scalability.

Technologies Used: MySQL, SQL, ERD Design
